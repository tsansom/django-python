# How the web works?
* start of by typing url into browser
* computer sends request as packet
  * includes ip address of website you're looking for
* sends request through wires or satellite which eventually links to your isp
* your isp will then reroute the request to the appropriate server location
* once your request reaches the server it can send back the website you asked for
  * full website with content too big to send back with a single packet
  * so server sends the website in multiple packets
  * packets don't care how they get to you, just final location
    * may take different paths
* once the packets reach you they reassemble to show you the website


# What does Full-Stack mean?
Front End - what you see as a user
Back End - the technology used to actually decide what to show you on the front end

## Front-End
Revolves around three technologies
* HTML
  * HyperText Markup language
  * every website will have HTML, it's the structure of the page
* CSS
  * Cascading Style Sheets
  * actual styling of the website (colors, fonts, etc)
  * not mandatory but almost all sites have it
* Javascript
  * allows you to add interactivity including programming logic
* will also hear about jQuery and Bootstrap but these are built using the previous three


## Back-End
This is where a multitude of options pop up

The Back-End has three components
* Language (Python)
* Framework (Django)
* Database (SQLite)
